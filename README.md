# ACSwinNet: A Deep Learning-Based Rigid Registration Method for Head-Neck CT-CBCT Images in Image-Guided Radiotherapy



## Introduction

By integrating a hybrid architecture that combines SwinTransformer with traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
we have enhanced the registration weight for the head region in the CBCT-CT rigid registration task, 
aiming to achieve more precise alignment of the head area. Paper download address:
